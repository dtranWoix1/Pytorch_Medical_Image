I can onyl run 10 epochs here due to the limitation of my hardware. That might be the reason the dice score is so low.

# Some major change against the original code

# within the 01-Processing:

import os
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print("Current Directory:", current_directory)

new_directory = "C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/Udemy/Pytorch/07-CAPSTONE-PROJECT--Lung-Tumor-Segmentation/07-CAPSTONE-PROJECT--Lung-Tumor-Segmentation"
os.chdir(new_directory)
print("Current Directory:", current_directory)

# within the 0-4-Train:

#switch the .ipynb into .py so that it can import the data
#the easiest way to do this is get all the code into Jupyter then download the file as .py
# then rename the file and moved them all into approriate folder, 
# for me is within the site-packages/dataset directory
from dataset.lung_dataset import LungDataset  
from dataset.lung_model import UNet

This might work for you I don't really know. But it works for me, just follow the error statement that pop-up and go that directory

# The GPU problem. The version of pytorch I used is 2.06 and the lecturer probably used 1.03 or something like that.
# So some code snippet got updated
gpus = 1 # I onyl have 1 GPU
trainer = pl.Trainer(
    devices=gpus, #replace gpus = gpus with devices =gpus
    logger=TensorBoardLogger(save_dir="./logs"),
    log_every_n_steps=1,
                     callbacks=checkpoint_callback,
                     max_epochs=10) # increase for more accurate, decrease to reduce computational time
