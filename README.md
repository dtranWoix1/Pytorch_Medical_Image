# the final model of 07-Capstone has a Val Dice Score is: 0.22702382504940033
# In the context of image segmentation tasks in machine learning,a Dice score close to 1 indicates perfect overlap (i.e., perfect segmentation),
# while a score close to 0 indicates no overlap. Closer to 1 is better
# This low score might be due to the low number of epoch = 10 instead of 30. This is due to the limitation of my hardware
# 10 epochs cost me 4.5 hours, so the default 30 epochs should be around 14 hours...
